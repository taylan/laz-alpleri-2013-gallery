Between the 21st and 28th of July 2013, I went on an awesome hiking trip around the Kackar Mountains.
Many photographs were taken and were geotagged.
I'm making a simple gallery with AngularJS and Bootstrap so that I can share the photographs and the places I've been with my friends, and the people who were with me during the trip.
