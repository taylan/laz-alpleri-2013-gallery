Between the 21st and 28th of July 2013, I went on an awesome hiking trip around the Kackar Mountains.
Many photographs were taken and were geotagged.

I'm making a simple gallery with [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and the [Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) so that I can share the photographs and the places I've been with my friends, and the people who were with me during the trip.
